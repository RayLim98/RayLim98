- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Raymond Lim! I'm a student studying at the University of Technology Sydney and studying a Bachelors of Engineering, Majoring in Mechanical and Mechtronics. Currenty in my final year of uni; I expect to gradaute by the end of this year (2022). 
- As a means to develop skills in my programming subjects, I started learning web development (in my own time) as it was a free resource rich area. Thanks to this venture, I have developed a keen interest in software development, making it a career I want to pursue in.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently starting off with making applications on Reactjs and React Native. I want to develop right mindset for developing software; keeping it simple, scalable, and semantic. 
- I'm using github as a way store my projects for my portfolio, and as a way to reflect on my development throughout the years.
